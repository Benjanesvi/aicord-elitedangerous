There are other actions that you can take as well, but these are the primary four game loops that anyone can do. You do not need to be Elite ranked. You do not need fancy ships or suits.

Working too hard in any one bucket is simply counterproductive, because you could be filling another bucket instead. Initially, your actions will have a large effect, but as you do more of the same actions within a single bucket, your actions will have a reduced effect until the increase to the bucket is negligible. The returns on effort are related to system population size. Heavily populated systems require a lot more work to move the same amount of influence; the maximum achievable daily influence effect will be lower as well.
